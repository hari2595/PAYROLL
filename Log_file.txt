Initial cleaning:
* First, we import all the required libraries.
* Then we load the data into a data frame called DF.
* Then we analyze the structure of the data, look for missing values, and the data types of the columns.
o Findings:
* There are less than 1%missing values in columns: JOB_CLASS_PGRADE, MOU, MOU_TITLE, REGULAR_PAY, OVERTIME_PAY, ALL_OTHER_PAY, GENDER, ETHNICITY.
* There are negative values in REGULAR_PAY, OVERTIME_PAY, ALL_OTHER_PAY, and TOTAL_PAY which should also be removed.
* There are minimum values in TOTAL_PAY which is less than the minimum wage which is not possible.
o Steps taken:
* Since both these findings only affect less than 1 % of the data, we can remove these records.
* We also remove data that are clearly less than minimum wage and not from the year 2022 because we only have 6 months of data from 2022.
Exploratory analysis:
* We try to know more about the data by knowing the unique categories of DEPARTMENT_TITLE, ETHNICITY, and YEAR.
* We check the general trend of incomes and outcomes.
* We check gender-wise pay trends
* We check ethnicity-wise pay differences.
* We also check department-wise pay and contribution.
* Finally, we check the least and most paying jobs
o Findings:
* There is a sharp hike in regular pay which in turn affected the total pay in 2019-2020.
* All other pay took a slight dip from 2016 – 2019
* Everything dipped in 2020 due to covid.
* Men in general get paid more than women
* Upon further analysis men in general also work more overtime than women.
* When it comes to pension contribution men are slightly paying more than women.
